# This is a build configuration that just contains a list of languages.
# It helps in situations where languages must come first in the list,
# mostly because screen densities interfere with the list of locales and
# the system misbehaves when a density is the first locale.

# These are all the locales that have translations and are displayable
# by TextView in this branch.
